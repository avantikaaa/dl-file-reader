# Assumption:
	- The input given is valid and follows the format of the sample inputs.
	
# Execution:
	- Run the command "make all" in the main directory to generate the executable "file"
	- Use the command "./file" to run the program

# Input to the program:
	- The first line takes the name of the input dl file.
	- The second line takes the name of the output dl file.

# Sample inputs:
	- There are 3 sample inputs (013_in_0/1/2.dl) present in the "input" directory.
	- To give these files as an input, the address must be specifed, i.e, the input to the program will be "input/013_in_0.dl"

# Sample outputs:
	- For each of the sample inputs, there are corresponding output files in the same directory.
